  <p>In twilight's gentle hush, the world begins anew,<br>
    A symphony of whispers, where night surrenders blue,<br>
    The stars in silver clusters fade, and morning paints the hue.
    <hr>
    The golden beams of sunrise dance upon the dew,<br>
    Awakening the flowers with a touch so pure and true,<br>
    The earth breathes life and wonder, in a canvas ever new.
    <hr>
    Amidst the stirring chorus, the heart finds solace too,<br>
    In nature's tender rhythm, a melody to pursue,<br>
    Where every dawn's a promise, and dreams are born anew.
